Imports: The code imports the necessary libraries (cv2 for OpenCV, os for file handling, and datetime for getting the current date and time).
Directory Setup: It creates a directory named captured_photos to store the captured images. If the directory already exists, it won't raise an error.
Video Capture Initialization:

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0): Opens the default camera (webcam) for capturing video.
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier(cv2.data.haarcascades + 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'): Loads the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
Image Capture Loop:

ret, frame = cap.read(): Captures a frame from the webcam. ret is a boolean indicating success, and frame is the captured image.
Converts the frame to grayscale (gray) for face detection.
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.3, minNeighbors=5): Detects faces in the image.
Face Processing:

For each detected face, it extracts the region of interest (ROI) and gets the current date and time.
Constructs a file name using the provided name and the current date and time.
Saves the face ROI as an image file in the captured_photos directory.
Draws a rectangle around the detected face in the original frame.
Writes the captured data (name, date, time, and file name) to a text file (user_data.txt).
Display and Exit:

Displays the frame with the drawn rectangle using cv2.imshow().
Checks for the 'q' key press to exit the loop and stop capturing.
Release and Cleanup:

Releases the webcam and closes all OpenCV windows using cap.release() and cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Main Function:

Prompts the user to enter their name.
Strips any leading/trailing whitespace from the name.
Calls the capture_image function if a valid name is entered.
Prints an error message if the name is invalid.
Script Entry Point:

The script is executed by calling main() if the script is run directly (not imported as a module).
